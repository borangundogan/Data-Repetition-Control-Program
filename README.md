# Data-Repetition-Control-Program
Checks for data duplication
The purpose of the program is: To compare the data kept in Excel and to check whether the same data repeats itself.
I know that excel can also do this, but I wanted to do it with a program because excel controls high data for a long time and even cannot do it from time to time.
